A sample implementation for regularized evolution and progressive neural architecture search using PyTorch. Based on Google's [regularized evolution implementation](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/evolution/regularized_evolution_algorithm) and
the paper of [Real et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01548).
